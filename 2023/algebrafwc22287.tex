\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Assertion (A):}The polynomial p(x)=$x^{2}+3x+3$ has two real zeroes.
	\\\textbf{Reason (R) :} A quadratic polynomial can have at most two zeroes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A). 
\item Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
\item Assertion (A) is true but Reason (R) is false.
\item Assertion (A) is false but Reason (R) is true.

\item Three bells ring at intervals of $ 6, 12 and 18 minutes$. If all the three bells rang at $ 6 a.m.,$ when will they ring together again ?

\item If the system of linear equations  \\ 		
\begin{align}
		2x + 3y = 7 and \\ 
		2ax + \brak{a+b}y = 28
\end{align}
\text have infinite number of solutions, then find the values of $' a '$and$' b '$.

\item If
\begin{align}
	 217x + 131y = 913 and \\
         131x + 217y = 827,
\end{align}
 then solve the equations for the values of $x$ and $y$.
