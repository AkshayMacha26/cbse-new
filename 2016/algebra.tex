\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve for $x$:
    \begin{align}
        \sqrt{6x + 7} - (2x - 7) = 0
    \end{align}
\item There are $100$ cards in a bag on which numbers from $1$ to $100$ are written. A card is taken out from the bag at random. Find the probability that the number on the selected card
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item is divisible by $9$ and is a perfect square.
        \item is a prime number greater than $80$.                  \end{enumerate}
\item A motor boat whose speed is $24 km/hr$ in still water takes $1$ hour     more to go $32 km$ upstream than to return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.
\item Two pipes running together can fill a tank in $11\frac{1}{9}$ minutes. If one pipe takes $5$ minutes more than the other to fill the tank separately, find the time in which each pipe would fill the tank separately.
