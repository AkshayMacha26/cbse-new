\begin{enumerate}
\item From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of
     the top of a tower is observed to be $60^{\degree}$. From a po    int $40 m$ vertically above the first point of observation, the     angle of elevation of the top of the tower is $30^{\degree}$.     Find the height of the tower and its horizontal distance from t    he point of observation.
\end{enumerate}
