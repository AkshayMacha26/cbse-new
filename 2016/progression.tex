\begin{enumerate}
								\item For what value of $k$ will $(k+9), (2k-1)$ and $( 2k+7)$ be consecutive terms of an A.P.?

\item The sums of the first $n$ terms of three arithmetic progressions are $S_0, S_2$ and $S_3$ respectively. The first term of each A.P. is $1$ and their common differences are $1, 2$ and $3$ respectively. Prove that $S_1 + S_3 = 2S_2$.
