\begin{enumerate}
    \item A card is drawn at random from a well-shuffled pack of $52$ playing cards. Find the probability of getting neither a red card nor a queen.

\item There are $100$ cards in a bag on which numbers from $1$ to $100$ are written. A card is taken out from the bag at random. Find the probability that the number on the selected card
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item is divisible by $9$ and is a perfect square.
        \item is a prime number greater than $80$.                  \end{enumerate}
